# Game Engine

This repo follows the development of the Hazel Engine by the Cherno: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel

Some goals in doing this:
- Learn more about C++
- Familiarize myself with creating and organizing a large C++ project with many components
- Familiarize myself with interacting with low level systems/hardware that is required in a game engine (but is extensible to other project types)
